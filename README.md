# Radiation-Levels-Calculator

Welcome to the Radiation Levels Calculator, a Python program designed to analyse radiation levels efficiently in various locations. 
This tool is based on scientific experiments, collecting multiple radiation measurements from different areas to provide valuable statistical insights.

FEATURES:

1.Statistical Insights:

The Radiation Levels Calculator computes essential statistical metrics, including:
Average: Understand the central tendency of radiation levels in each location.
Standard Deviation: Assess the variability and dispersion of radiation data.
Range: Gain insights into the spread of radiation levels within a dataset.
Correlation: Measure the strength and direction of linear relationships between radiation levels in different locations.

2.User-Friendly Input:

* Easily input radiation measurements for new locations.
* Seamlessly integrate new data into calculations for continuous analysis.

3.Efficiency and Functionality:

* Retrieve existing data without re-entering radiation levels for improved efficiency.
* Skip redundant self-comparisons to optimise processing time. Correlation comparisons with the same location are skipped as they provide redundant information (correlation with itself is always 1).

4.How to Use:

* Run the program.
* Input radiation levels for each location.
* Analyse statistical insights for each location.
* Integrate new data seamlessly.
* Gain a comprehensive understanding of radiation patterns and relationships.

Important Note:
Skipping self-comparisons and redundant calculations enhances the program's efficiency, ensuring a smoother experience for the user. 
The tool is designed to be user-friendly, allowing for easy analysis and integration of new data.
